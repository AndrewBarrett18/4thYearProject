code from https://github.com/galenballew/SDC-Lane-and-Vehicle-Detection-Tracking
Download this whole folder then the jupyter notebook will work. Take a look through the one I uploaded as it shows the lane detection for a test image.

It's quite long and probably not the most efficient but we can use it for now and find a better one later if we can,
at least it will show (in the report) what we're trying to do, that we have found something to use and if the accuracy can be improved, then that will be one of the next things we will tackle.
I got rid of video testing for now to make it clearer and left in image testing.

The images need to be 1280x720 as this is the camera size; so need to resize any frames we want to test. 
Images in 'test_images’ from ‘test7’ to ‘test9’ are from the dataset we found.
