### Accuracy Testing
TuSimple dataset used. How to verify accuracy? @Myles pls fill in cheers

TuSimple accuracy 95.48% on 800 images
Jiqing Expressway Dataset -  82% (400 examples) accuracy in this data set - possibly down to size of image discrepancy and down sampling ?
CULANE - 90.56% (150 examples)
