Uploaded two lane detectors; 'SimpleLaneDetection' didn't perform well on the couple of images I tested from the dataset we found.
Check the 'out_images' on each of them to have a quick look at performance.

To test the full implementation, add the dataset to 'test_images' in the LaneDetection folder. Then run the 'object_detection.ipynb' file in TensorflowObjectDetection/research/object_detection.
